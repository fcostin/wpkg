<!--
  NOTES
  1) Removal is not completely silent, but does not require interaction.
  2) Printer driver installation is not silent, happens when printer is not
     there yet.
  3) Printer port stays behind, if you misconfigured it remove and reinstall
     won't fix anything. You can delete the port by selecting 'Server
     properties' in the 'File' menu for 'Add/remove printers' and selecting
     delete there.
