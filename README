This project has WPKG package configuration files.

A lot of it is inspired by (and copied from) the WPKG wiki so much gratitude is owed.

The following criteria must be fulfilled before the recipe is included here:

1) 32-bit and 64-bit safe

2) Uses "msiexec /x package_file.msi" for uninstallations whenever possible to avoid knowing CLSIDs that change


NOTES
=====

a) All revisions should be written out as a proper revision number. Examples:
  4.65, 9.2.0.61 and so on

b) All revision should have an additional identifier following a hypen, this gives us 10 tries to get a new version right and allow overriding the central version. Examples:
  4.65-0, 9.2.0.61-0 and so on
