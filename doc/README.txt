This project has WPKG package configuration files.

A lot of it is inspired by (and copied from) the WPKG wiki so much gratitude is owed.

The following criteria must be fulfilled before the recipe is included here:

1) 32-bit and 64-bit safe

2) Uses "msiexec /x package_file.msi" for uninstallations whenever possible to avoid knowing CLSIDs that change


NOTES
=====

a) All revisions should be written out without dots. Examples:
  4.65 -> 465
  9.2.0.61 -> 92061

b) All revision should have an additional identifier, this gives us 10 tries to get a new version right and allow overriding the central version. Examples:
  4.65-0 -> 4650
  9.2.0.61-0 -> 920610

c) Priorities are set as follows
   10 - most normal applications
   50 - system applications (IE8 and others)
  100 - critical install first apps (Windows Installer 4.5)

d) Rebooting - all should have their reboot priority set to "false" and only reboot (postponed) in case of 3010 or similar return codes.

e) Ensure that the following variables are defined in your WPKG settings.xml file
  MSI      - set to "/quiet /norestart" (without quotes)
  MSP      - set to "REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=omus" (without quotes)
  SOFTWARE - set to root of the applications
  WPKG     - set to root of server WPKG installation without trailing backslash
